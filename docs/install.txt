# Installation is complete...
# 
# To bring down the containers:
# sudo chmod +x stop.sh
# sudo ./start.sh
# 
# 
# To bring up the containers:
# sudo chmod +x start.sh
# sudo ./stop.sh
# 
# 
# Make sure to run (some) commands in docker with:
# sudo docker exec -it container_id_or_name commandhere
# 
# To remove docker and rebuild from scratch, run:
# sudo docker system prune -a -f
# OR TO JUST REBUILD: cd docker/ then:
# sudo docker-compose build
#
# To attach to ALL containers to view output do: 
# sudo screen -S docker
# then
# sudo docker-compose up
#
# To to disconnect from docker do ctrl+a then press d
# To to reconnect to docker screen do: screen -x docker
# 
# To allow access to docker containers follow this template:
# sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i docker0 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
# sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o docker0 -j ACCEPT
# sudo route add -net <dockerip> netmask <net mask> gw <docker's host>
# 
# If you need to import more peers run after adding them to config in main directory:
# sudo ./addnodes.sh
# ...Just make sure docker containers are UP AND RUNNING first ;)
#
# ...OR you could subscribe to the node's transactions:
# Edit the subscription0.json or subscription1.json in scripts/
# sudo nano subscription0.json
# INPUT the phase requirement, phase port, node ID, and host then: ctrl + o to save ctrl + x to exit then:
# sudo python sendtransaction.py
# Input the filename as "subscription0.json" and hit enter (use quotes). That transaction ID will output at the bottom of the screen.
# Check the transaction in http://localhost:80/transaction/transactionidhere (maybe check docker for more info)
# 
# Have a good day!
