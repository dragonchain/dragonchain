# Security Policy

The Dragonchain project is dedicated towards finding and eliminating any possible security vulnerabilities that may arise. This includes this repository as well as all auxillary Dragonchain repositories.

## Supported Versions

Please not that this project currently only supports the latest major version.

If you are running an old version of Dragonchain, we always advise updating, and in the case of breaking changes there will be provided documentation to help you migrate to a newer version if necessary.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We have a bug and security bounty program which is [available here](https://dragonchain.com/bug-and-security-bounty).

Please do not submit security vulnerabilities publicly, and instead use the link above to disclose any security vulnerabilities.

Please follow reasonable [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). Failure to do so will disqualify the security vulnerability from the bounty program.

When in doubt if a bug is a security vulnerability, please contact us first.
