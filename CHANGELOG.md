# Changelog

## 3.5.0

- **Feature:**
  - Switch to using files for reading secrets for dynamic secret update support
  - Use new schema for NETWORK (for L5 registration and blocks). Will now look like "{blockchain} {extra_data}"
    i.e. "bitcoin testnet3" or "ethereum network_id 2" rather than a pre-set list of enums as before.
    (This allows for things such as custom/private ethereum networks, etc)
  - Add support for creating/saving various interchain networks, including custom interchain nodes, keys, etc
    - Note this also means that a chain can have multiple addresses for the same type of network now (i.e. many ETH addresses)
  - Add routes for refactored interchain support:
    - `POST /v1/interchains/bitcoin` Create a bitcoin network for the dragonchain to use
    - `POST /v1/interchains/ethereum` Create an ethereum network for the dragonchain to use
    - `PATCH /v1/interchains/bitcoin/<id>` Update an already existing bitcoin network of dragonchain
    - `PATCH /v1/interchains/ethereum/<id>` Update an already existing ethereum network of dragonchain
    - `POST /v1/interchains/bitcoin/<id>/transaction` Create a bitcoin transaction using one of the chain's networks
    - `POST /v1/interchains/ethereum/<id>/transaction` Create a ethereum transaction using one of the chain's networks
    - `GET /v1/interchains/<blockchain>` Get a list of all registered Dragonchain interchains
    - `GET /v1/interchains/<blockchain>/<id>` Get a particular interchain network from the chain
    - `DELETE /v1/interchains/<blockchain>/<id>` Delete a particular interchain network from the chain
    - `POST /v1/interchains/default` (L5 only) Set a default network for level 5 chains to use
    - `GET /v1/interchains/default` (L5 only) Get the default network set on a level 5 chain
  - Move the following routes legacy support only (they will work for chains upgraded from an old version for backwards compatibility, but will 404 on new chains):
    - `GET /public-blockchain-address`
    - `GET /v1/public-blockchain-address`
    - `POST /public-blockchain-transaction`
    - `POST /v1/public-blockchain-transaction`
  - Reduced initial delay checks for the webserver so kubernetes will mark the webserver as ready quicker
