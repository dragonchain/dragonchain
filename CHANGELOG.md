## 4.1.0

Note this update adds the invoker tag field for indexing smart contract
transactions. This will only be added for all new smart contracts after
updating to this version (or newer). If you want/need to retroactively index
this field for existing transactions,
[check these docs](https://dragonchain-core-docs.dragonchain.com/latest/deployment/migrating_v4.html#manually-triggering-a-reindex)
for info on manually triggering a re-index which will populate the invoker
field where necessary.

- **Feature:**
  - Default error reporting to save to disk, so that crash logs/tracebacks can be automatically saved
  - Provide better error message when bad input to api doesn't match required schemas
  - Adds verification-notification callback in the receipt endpoint
  - Add indexed redisearch tag field "invoker" by default when indexing smart contract transactions
  - Remove max limit for custom indexes on a transaction type/smart contract
- **Bugs:**
  - Fix a bug where getting the cached list of verifications for a block would always fail
  - Fix a bug where existing interchain networks could be overwritten if trying to create a new network with the same blockchain and name
  - Fix a bug where the chain could not parse very old legacy transactions from storage
  - Fix a bug where L5s returned a 404 for the status endpoint when a default interchain was not yet set
  - Fix a bug where very large payloads could attempt to be cached and crash the caching redis
  - Fix a bug so that non-existant routes in the api now properly return a 404
  - Fix a bug where accepting the disable_schedule parameter when updating a contract didn't do anything
  - Fix a bug where the deadline key for l2+ nodes skipping unneeded blocks was generated incorrectly
  - Fix a bug where custom indexes text fields couldn't have both sortable and nostem at the same time
- **Documentation:**
  - Change dragonchain deployment docs to reflect helm install changes from helm repository with pinned version

  - Update aioredis, docker, boto3, web3, redis, fastjsonschema, and aiohttp dependencies

## 4.0.0

This update introduces a breaking change required by the switch from
ElasticSearch to redisearch. These changes primarily exist with custom
indexing, and how querying is preformed. Please read the

  - Refactor all query endpoints, including changing query inputs (Breaking Change)
  - Changed route for `GET /v1/contract` from a query to a list (Breaking Change)
  - Add support to disable schedule when updating a smart contract
- **Documentation:**
  - Update documentation for redisearch
  - Add new page for migration considerations when upgrading from v3 to v4
  - Add RAM usage requirements
  - Add info about bug/security/project bounty programs
- **Development:**
  - Add logs when getting storage errors
  - Resolve all bandit errors and turn up bandit verbosity
  - Move/extract entire helm chart for better control
- **Packaging:**
  - Update helm chart version, adding redisearch while removing elasticsearch
  - Remove service links from mounting on pods in the helm chart
  - Expose redis and redisearch image locations in opensource-config.yaml
  - Add redisearch and remove elasticsearch from requirements.txt
  - Update boto3, bit, and aiohttp packages
  - Update fwatchdog to 0.18.0 for OpenFaaS smart contracts
- **CICD:**

## 3.5.0

- **Feature:**
  - Switch to using files for reading secrets for dynamic secret update support
  - Use new schema for NETWORK (for L5 registration and blocks). Will now look like "{blockchain} {extra_data}"
    i.e. "bitcoin testnet3" or "ethereum network_id 2" rather than a pre-set list of enums as before.
    (This allows for things such as custom/private ethereum networks, etc)
  - Add support for creating/saving various interchain networks, including custom interchain nodes, keys, etc
    - Note this also means that a chain can have multiple addresses for the same type of network now (i.e. many ETH addresses)
  - Add routes for refactored interchain support:
    - `POST /v1/interchains/bitcoin` Create a bitcoin network for the dragonchain to use
    - `POST /v1/interchains/ethereum` Create an ethereum network for the dragonchain to use
    - `PATCH /v1/interchains/bitcoin/<id>` Update an already existing bitcoin network of dragonchain
    - `PATCH /v1/interchains/ethereum/<id>` Update an already existing ethereum network of dragonchain
    - `POST /v1/interchains/bitcoin/<id>/transaction` Create a bitcoin transaction using one of the chain's networks
    - `POST /v1/interchains/ethereum/<id>/transaction` Create a ethereum transaction using one of the chain's networks
    - `GET /v1/interchains/<blockchain>` Get a list of all registered Dragonchain interchains
    - `GET /v1/interchains/<blockchain>/<id>` Get a particular interchain network from the chain
    - `DELETE /v1/interchains/<blockchain>/<id>` Delete a particular interchain network from the chain
    - `POST /v1/interchains/default` (L5 only) Set a default network for level 5 chains to use
    - `GET /v1/interchains/default` (L5 only) Get the default network set on a level 5 chain
  - Move the following routes legacy support only (they will work for chains upgraded from an old version for backwards compatibility, but will 404 on new chains):
    - `GET /public-blockchain-address`
    - `GET /v1/public-blockchain-address`
    - `POST /public-blockchain-transaction`
    - `POST /v1/public-blockchain-transaction`
