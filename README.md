## üìù Documentation

Documentation for this specific repository are [available here](https://dragonchain-core-docs.dragonchain.com/latest/).

This documentation is intended for developers wishing to learn about and contribute to the Dragonchain core platform itself.

For _interaction_ with the Dragonchain, we recommend using the [Getting Started link](https://docs.dragonchain.com/) instead.

You can also view one of our SDKs (or their docs) to start interacting with a Dragonchain:

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

Dragonchain is implemented in Python 3, packaged into container images with Docker, and intended to be run on Kubernetes (at the moment).

The [tools.sh](/tools.sh) script is used to assist in various development functions such as installing dependencies,
automatically formatting/linting code, running tests, etc. Simply run `./tools.sh` with no parameters to view what it
can do.

In order to develop locally you should be able to run `./tools.sh full-test` and have all checks pass. For this, a few requirements should be met:

1. Ensure that you have python 3.8 installed locally
1. Install OS dependencies for building various python package dependencies:
   - On an arch linux system (with pacman): `./tools.sh arch-install`
   - On a debian-based linux system (with apt): `./tools.sh deb-install` (Note on newer Ubuntu installations
     you may need to install `libsecp256k1-dev` if the secp256k1 python package fails to build)
   - On a Mac (with brew): `./tools.sh mac-install`
1. Install the python requirements: `./tools.sh pip-install`
   (Note this will install the python packages to the current user's site-packages.
   For a python venv, follow the steps below)
1. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is required to be installed for linting the helm chart.
1. [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) is required to be installed for building the docs, as it parses the helm chart's version to update the docs dynamically.

### Using a Python Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a python virtual environment rather than simply installing the python
package requirements to your global environment. This allows the required packages for this project
to be separated from the rest of the (potentially conflicting) packages from the rest of the system.

In order to do this, instead of step 3 above, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure you have python venv installed, and run `python3.8 -m venv .venv`
1. Activate the virtual environment in your shell by running `source .venv/bin/activate`
1. Upgrade the setup dependencies for the virtual environment: `pip install -U pip setuptools`
1. Install the core dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Install the dev dependencies: `pip install -U -r dev_requirements.txt`
